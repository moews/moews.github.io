My research interests are mostly centered on the intersection of statistics and machine learning with novel application areas. Current projects deal with parallelized Bayesian nonparametrics and multi-messenger constraints, statistical denoising and spatial analysis, generative models and deep learning for anomaly detection in large datasets, and hybrid analytic and machine learning frameworks for simulations.

Current projects deal with Bayesian nonparametrics and multi-messenger constraints in upcoming surveys, large-scale structure and cosmic voids as astronomical laboratories, generative models and deep learning for anomaly detection in observations, and hybrid analytic and machine learning frameworks for galaxy evolution in cosmological simulations. In addition, my research covers topics in computational finance and management science.-->

<!--My research interests are mostly centered on the intersection of cosmology, astrostatistics and machine learning. Iâ€™m part of the McWilliams Center for Cosmology at Carnegie Mellon University as well as the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and the new NSF AI Planning Institute. My current projects deal with Bayesian nonparametrics for parallelized and high-dimensional cosmological parameter estimation for upcoming surveys such as LSST and Euclid, with large-scale structure weak lensing and tests of gravitational theories through cosmic voids, with deep learning for anomaly detection in astronomical observations, and with hybrid analytic and machine learning frameworks to emulate hydrodynamical simulations. In addition, my research covers topics in quantitative finance and management science. Below is a (rough) list of my research interests and visits:-->

## Statistics / machine learning:

* Non-parametric Bayesian methods
* Estimation theory and sampling
* Deep learning techniques
* 
## Cosmology and astrophysics:

* Dark energy and large-scale structure
* Cosmological parameter estimation
* Galaxy formation and evolution

## Finance, OR and other fields:

* FinTech and market microstructure
* Portfolio and risk optimization
* Quantitative criminology
