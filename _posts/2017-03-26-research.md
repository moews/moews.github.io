My research is centred on the development and application of approaches in machine learning, statistical inference and high-performance computing to address domain challenges under the broad umbrella of predictive analytics. Current projects include, among others, market microstructure and information efficiency in emerging markets, geospatial analysis and simulation-based approaches to crime prevention, and impacts from healthcare crises and technology infrastructure disruptions.

## Machine learning & applied statistics

* Non-parametric Bayesian methods
* Estimation theory and sampling
* Deep learning techniques

## Operational research & public policy

* Geospatial analysis and simulations
* Healthcare analytics and crises
* Quantitative criminology

## Computational finance & economics

* FinTech and market microstructure
* Efficiency in financial markets 
* Econometric forecasting

## Research visits and programmes:

* 2022: [Co-organizer of the AI Super-Resolution Simulations Workshop (USA)](https://events.mcs.cmu.edu/aisrs22/)
* 2020-2021: Limited travel due to thesis write-up and a pandemic (everywhere)
* 2019: [Member of the Cosmostatistics Initiative Residence Program 6 (France)](https://cosmostatistics-initiative.org/residence-programs/crp6/)

My research interests are mostly centered on the intersection of statistics and machine learning with novel application areas. Current projects deal with parallelized Bayesian nonparametrics and multi-messenger constraints, statistical denoising and spatial analysis, generative models and deep learning for anomaly detection, and hybrid analytic and machine learning frameworks for simulations.

## Statistics & machine learning:

* Non-parametric Bayesian methods
* Estimation theory and sampling

## Management science & finance:

* Geospatial analysis and optimization
* FinTech and econometric methods
* Computational criminology

## Cosmology & astrostatistics:

* Dark energy and large-scale structure
* Cosmological parameter estimation
* Galaxy formation and evolution
