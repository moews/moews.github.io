My research interests are mostly centered on the intersection of cosmology, astrostatistics and machine learning. I'm part of the Institute for Astronomy at the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh, where my current projects deal primarily with Bayesian nonparametrics for parallelized and high-dimensional cosmological parameter estimation for the Dark Energy Survey, and with machine learning for feedback-based models of galaxy evolution in the context of cosmological hydrodynamical and N-body simulations. Below is a (rough) list of my main research interests and visits:

## Cosmology and astrophysics:

* Cosmological parameter estimation
* Galaxy formation and evolution
* Theories of dark energy

## Statistics and machine learning:

* Non-parametric Bayesian methods
* Estimation theory and sampling
* Deep learning techniques


## Research visits and programs:

* 2019: [Cosmostatistics Initiative Residence Program (France)](https://cosmostatistics-initiative.org/residence-programs/crp6/)
* 2018: [Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (Chile)](http://www.ctio.noao.edu/noao)
* 2018: [Cosmostatistics Initiative Residence Program (Greece)](https://cosmostatistics-initiative.org/residence-programs/coin-residence-program-5-chania-greece/)
* 2018: [Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics (Germany)](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de)
* 2018: [Dublin School on Gravitational Wave Source Modelling (Ireland)](https://maths.ucd.ie/dsgwsm)

## News articles and other media:

* ["This AI system can generate images of artificial galaxies" (VentureBeat and others)](https://venturebeat.com/2018/11/08/this-ai-system-can-generate-images-of-artificial-galaxies)
* ["Fear of the dark: Caveats of using supernovae to probe the nature of dark energy" (COIN)](https://cosmostatistics-initiative.org/sncosmo/)
