My research is centred on the development and application of approaches in machine learning, statistical inference and high-performance computing to address domain challenges under the broad umbrella of predictive analytics. Below is a (non-exhaustive) list of my areas of interest.

<!--Current projects include, among others, market microstructure and information efficiency in emerging markets, geospatial analysis and simulation-based approaches to crime prevention, and impacts from healthcare crises and technology infrastructure disruptions.-->

## Machine learning & applied statistics

<!--
* Non-parametric Bayesian methods
* Estimation theory and sampling
* Deep learning techniques
-->

* Generative models and synthetic data
* Estimation theory and sampling
* Deep learning techniques

## Operational research & public policy

* Geopatial analysis and simulations
* Military and humanitarian risk
* Quantitative criminology

## Computational finance & economics

* FinTech and market microstructure
* Efficiency in financial markets 
* Econometric forecasting

## Cosmology & astrostatistical models

* Large-scale structure and lensing
* Galaxy formation and evolution
* Cosmological parameters
