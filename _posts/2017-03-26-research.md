My research is centred on the development and application of approaches in machine learning, statistical inference and high-performance computing to address domain challenges under the broad umbrella of predictive analytics. Below is a (non-exhaustive) list of my areas of interest.

<!--Current projects include, among others, market microstructure and information efficiency in emerging markets, geospatial analysis and simulation-based approaches to crime prevention, and impacts from healthcare crises and technology infrastructure disruptions.-->

## Machine learning & applied statistics

* Non-parametric Bayesian methods
* Estimation theory and sampling
* Deep learning techniques

## Operational research & public policy

* Geospatial analysis and simulations
* Healthcare and military analytics
* Quantitative criminology

## Computational finance & economics

* FinTech and market microstructure
* Efficiency in financial markets 
* Econometric forecasting

## Cosmology & theoretical astrophysics
* Cosmological parameter estimation
* Galaxy formation and evolution
* Astrostatistical methods

My research interests are mostly centered on the intersection of statistics and machine learning with novel application areas. Current projects deal with parallelized Bayesian nonparametrics and multi-messenger constraints, statistical denoising and spatial analysis, generative models and deep learning for anomaly detection, and hybrid analytic and machine learning frameworks for simulations.
