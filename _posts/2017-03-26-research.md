My research is centred on the development and application of approaches in machine learning, statistical inference and high-performance computing to address domain challenges under the broad umbrella of predictive analytics. Below is a (non-exhaustive) list of my areas of interest.

<!--Current projects include, among others, market microstructure and information efficiency in emerging markets, geospatial analysis and simulation-based approaches to crime prevention, and impacts from healthcare crises and technology infrastructure disruptions.-->

## Machine learning & applied statistics

* Non-parametric Bayesian methods
* Estimation theory and sampling
* Deep learning techniques

<!--
## Operational research & public policy

* Humanitarian and military analytics
* Spatial analysis and simulations
* Quantitative criminology
-->

## Operational research & public policy

* Geospatial analysis and simulations
* Healthcare statistics and crises

## Computational finance & economics

* FinTech and market microstructure
* Efficiency in financial markets 
* Econometric forecasting

## Extra: Astrophysics & astrostatistics
* Cosmological parameter estimation
* Large-scale structure and voids
* Models of galaxy evolution
