Potential PhD and master's students interested in working within one of these areas, or on a broadly related topic, are welcome to send me an email with their CV and a research plan. I'm also open to the supervision of research students with a background in different numerate disciplines such as physics and computer science who are looking to change fields, as well as joint supervisions with other schools at the University of Edinburgh and serving as a secondary supervisor.
