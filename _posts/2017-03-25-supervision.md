Primary areas for my research supervision include the following overarching themes:

* Applied Machine Learning
* Computational Finance
* Healthcare Analytics
* Spatial Statistics

I'm also open to joint supervisions with other schools at the University of Edinburgh.

Potential PhD and master's students interested in working within one of these areas, or on a related topic in line with my broader research programme, are welcome to send me an email with their CV and, for PhD students, a research plan. Please also indicate whether you are self-funded or not.
