Potential areas for my research supervision cover the following overarching themes:

* Applied Machine Learning
* Quantitative Criminology
* Financial Econometrics 
* Healthcare Analytics 
* Geospatial Statistics

I'm also open to joint supervisions with other schools at the University of Edinburgh.

Potential PhD and master's students interested in working within one of these areas, or on a related topic in line with my broader research programme, are welcome to send me an email with their CV and, for PhD students, a research plan. Please also indicate whether you are self-funded or not.
