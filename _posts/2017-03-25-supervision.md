Potential PhD and master's students interested in working within one of these areas, or on a broadly related topic in line with my research profile, are welcome to send me an email with their CV and a research proposal. I'm also open to the supervision of students with a background in different numerate disciplines such as physics and computer science who are looking to change fields, as well as joint supervisions with other schools at the University of Edinburgh.
