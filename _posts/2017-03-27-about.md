Hi! I'm Ben, and I'm a Lecturer in Predictive Analytics at the University of Edinburgh. Before moving back to Scotland, I was a McWilliams Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University in the United States, where I was also part of the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and the National Science Foundation's AI Planning Institute. Prior to my time in Pittsburgh, I completed my PhD in Astrophysics as a Principal's Career Development Scholar at the Royal Observatory Edinburgh. With a detour through an MSc in Artificial Intelligence and related work as a Research Engineer for Machine Learning in the financial asset management sector before my doctoral studies, I'm also an accredited Graduate Statistician with the American Statistical Association. My research is centred on the development and application of approaches in machine learning, statistical inference and high-performance computing to address current domain challenges in a variety of areas.
