Hi! I’m Ben, and I’m a McWilliams Fellow in the Department of Physics at Carnegie Mellon University, where I'm also part of the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Centre. Prior to moving to the United States, I received my PhD in astrophysics from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland as a Principal's Career Development Scholar at the Royal Observatory Edinburgh, where I was also part of the university's Centre for Statistics.

<br>
With a previous detour through a master's degree in artificial intelligence as well as related work in the UK's financial asset management sector before my doctoral studies, I'm also an accredited Graduate Statistician with the American Statistical Association and part of the NSF AI Planning Institute for Data-Driven Discovery in Physics. Collaborations with other departments have ranged from obvious (computer science and mathematics) to unusual (business and criminal justice).

<br>
My primary research area is cosmology, with a strong grounding in  machine learning, statistics and high-performance computing, making me a “machine cosmologist” at heart.
