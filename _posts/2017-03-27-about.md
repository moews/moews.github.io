Hi! I'm Ben, and I'm a final-year PhD candidate in astrophysics and Principal's Career Development Scholar at the University of Edinburgh's School of Physics and Astronomy. With a previous detour through a master's degree in artificial intelligence and a specialization in machine learning, as well as related research and development work in the UK's financial asset management sector before my doctoral studies, I'm also an accredited Graduate Statistician with the American Statistical Association and part of the University of Edinburgh's Centre for Statistics. Starting in fall 2021, I will become a McWilliams Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University's Department of Physics, where I will also be part of the new NSF AI Planning Institute and the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. My primary research area is cosmology, with a strong grounding in methods of the aforementioned fields.
