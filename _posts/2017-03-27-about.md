Hi! I’m Ben, and I’m a McWilliams Fellow in the Department of Physics at Carnegie Mellon University, where I'm also part of the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Centre. With a previous detour through a master's degree in artificial intelligence as well as related work in the UK's financial asset management sector before my doctoral studies, I'm also an accredited Graduate Statistician with the American Statistical Association and part of the NSF AI Planning Institute for Data-Driven Discovery in Physics. Prior to moving to the United States, I received my PhD in astrophysics from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland as a Principal's Career Development Scholar at the Royal Observatory Edinburgh, where I was also part of the university's Centre for Statistics. My primary research area is cosmology, with a strong grounding in methods of the aforementioned fields.
